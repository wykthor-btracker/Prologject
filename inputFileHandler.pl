%%  In this module you will find two usefull functions                  %
%%  made for file manipulation, the 'copy' function takes an            %
%%  input file and a output file as a argument, then what it does       %
%%  is simply taking the contents of InputFile argument and copying     %
%%  it to OutputFile, while printing the contents of InputFile.         %
%%  The onlyRead function takes only one argument and that is           %
%%  an InputFile, printing its contents.                                %
